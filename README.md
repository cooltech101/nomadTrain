General Navigation Models are general-purpose goal-conditioned visual navigation policies trained on diverse, cross-embodiment training data, and can control many different robots in zero-shot. They can also be efficiently fine-tuned, or adapted, to new robots and downstream tasks. Our family of models is described in the following research papers (and growing):
1. [GNM: A General Navigation Model to Drive Any Robot](https://sites.google.com/view/drive-any-robot) (_October 2022_, presented at ICRA 2023)
2. [ViNT: A Foundation Model for Visual Navigation](https://general-navigation-models.github.io/vint/index.html) (_June 2023_, presented at CoRL 2023)
3. [NoMaD: Goal Masking Diffusion Policies for Navigation and Exploration](https://general-navigation-models.github.io/nomad/index.html) (_October 2023_)

## Overview
This repository contains code for training our family of models with your own data, pre-trained model checkpoints, as well as example code to deploy it on a TurtleBot2/LoCoBot robot. The repository follows the organization from [GNM](https://github.com/PrieureDeSion/drive-any-robot).

- `./train/train.py`: training script to train or fine-tune the ViNT model on your custom data.
- `./train/vint_train/models/`: contains model files for GNM, ViNT, and some baselines.
- `./train/process_*.py`: scripts to process rosbags or other formats of robot trajectories into training data.
- `./deployment/src/record_bag.sh`: script to collect a demo trajectory as a ROS bag in the target environment on the robot. This trajectory is subsampled to generate a topological graph of the environment.
- `./deployment/src/create_topomap.sh`: script to convert a ROS bag of a demo trajectory into a topological graph that the robot can use to navigate.
- `./deployment/src/navigate.sh`: script that deploys a trained GNM/ViNT/NoMaD model on the robot to navigate to a desired goal in the generated topological graph. Please see relevant sections below for configuration settings.
- `./deployment/src/explore.sh`: script that deploys a trained NoMaD model on the robot to randomly explore its environment. Please see relevant sections below for configuration settings.

## Train

This subfolder contains code for processing datasets and training models from your own data.

### Pre-requisites

The codebase assumes access to a workstation running Ubuntu (tested on 18.04 and 20.04), Python 3.7+, and a GPU with CUDA 10+. It also assumes access to conda, but you can modify it to work with other virtual environment packages, or a native setup.
### Setup
Run the commands below inside the `vint_release/` (topmost) directory:
1. Set up the conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f train/train_environment.yml
    ```
2. Source the conda environment:
    ```
    conda activate vint_train
    ```
3. Install the vint_train packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -e train/
    ```
4. Install the `diffusion_policy` package from this [repo](https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy):
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:real-stanford/diffusion_policy.git
    pip install -e diffusion_policy/
    ```


### Data-Wrangling
In the [papers](https://general-navigation-models.github.io), we train on a combination of publicly available and unreleased datasets. Below is a list of publicly available datasets used for training; please contact the respective authors for access to the unreleased data.
- [RECON](https://sites.google.com/view/recon-robot/dataset)
- [TartanDrive](https://github.com/castacks/tartan_drive)
- [SCAND](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~xiao/SCAND/SCAND.html#Links)
- [GoStanford2 (Modified)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RYseCpbtHEFOsmSX2uqNY_kvSxwZLVP_?usp=sharing)
- [SACSoN/HuRoN](https://sites.google.com/view/sacson-review/huron-dataset)

We recommend you to download these (and any other datasets you may want to train on) and run the processing steps below.

#### Data Processing 

We provide some sample scripts to process these datasets, either directly from a rosbag or from a custom format like HDF5s:
1. Run `process_bags.py` with the relevant args, or `process_recon.py` for processing RECON HDF5s. You can also manually add your own dataset by following our structure below (if you are adding a custom dataset, please checkout the [Custom Datasets](#custom-datasets) section).
2. Run `data_split.py` on your dataset folder with the relevant args.

After step 1 of data processing, the processed dataset should have the following structure:

```
├── <dataset_name>
│   ├── <name_of_traj1>
│   │   ├── 0.jpg
│   │   ├── 1.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── T_1.jpg
│   │   └── traj_data.pkl
│   ├── <name_of_traj2>
│   │   ├── 0.jpg
│   │   ├── 1.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── T_2.jpg
│   │   └── traj_data.pkl
│   ...
└── └── <name_of_trajN>
    	├── 0.jpg
    	├── 1.jpg
    	├── ...
        ├── T_N.jpg
        └── traj_data.pkl
```  

Each `*.jpg` file contains an forward-facing RGB observation from the robot, and they are temporally labeled. The `traj_data.pkl` file is the odometry data for the trajectory. It’s a pickled dictionary with the keys:
- `"position"`: An np.ndarray [T, 2] of the xy-coordinates of the robot at each image observation.
- `"yaw"`: An np.ndarray [T,] of the yaws of the robot at each image observation.


After step 2 of data processing, the processed data-split should the following structure inside `/visualnav-transformer/train/vint_train/data/data_splits`:

```
├── <dataset_name>
│   ├── train
|   |   └── traj_names.txt
└── └── test
        └── traj_names.txt 
``` 

### Training your General Navigation Models
Run this inside the `vint_release/train` directory:
```bash
python train.py -c <path_of_train_config_file>
```
The premade config yaml files are in the `train/config` directory. 

#### Custom Config Files
You can use one of the premade yaml files as a starting point and change the values as you need. `config/vint.yaml` is good choice since it has commented arguments. `config/defaults.yaml` contains the default config values (don't directly train with this config file since it does not specify any datasets for training).

#### Custom Datasets
Make sure your dataset and data-split directory follows the structures provided in the [Data Processing](#data-processing) section. Locate `train/vint_train/data/data_config.yaml` and append the following:

```
<dataset_name>:
    metric_waypoints_distance: <average_distance_in_meters_between_waypoints_in_the_dataset>
```

Locate your training config file and add the following text under the `datasets` argument (feel free to change the values of `end_slack`, `goals_per_obs`, and `negative_mining`):
```
<dataset_name>:
    data_folder: <path_to_the_dataset>
    train: data/data_splits/<dataset_name>/train/ 
    test: data/data_splits/<dataset_name>/test/ 
    end_slack: 0 # how many timesteps to cut off from the end of each trajectory  (in case many trajectories end in collisions)
    goals_per_obs: 1 # how many goals are sampled per observation
    negative_mining: True # negative mining from the ViNG paper (Shah et al.)
```

#### Collecting and processing custom ROS2 bags
You can collect your own ROS2 bags from your robot embodiment for finetuning NoMaD. This can also be done in Isaac Sim environments. Collect the data in ROS2 format, then convert back to ROS1 format and process it as described above. 

Record the image and odometry topics in ROS2 format.
``` bash
ros2 bag record <image topic> <odom topic>
```

Convert to ROS1 format
``` bash
rosbags-convert --src <path to ROS2 bag dir> --dst <name the new ROS1 bag>
```

Process the ROS1 bags using process_bags.py and data_split.py. The results of data_split.py will be found in `/visualnav-transformer/train/vint_train/data/data_splits`. Move the results of process_bags.py to this folder. The structure should be as follows:
```
├── <dataset_name>
│   ├── <name_of_traj1>
│   │   ├── 0.jpg
│   │   ├── 1.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── T_1.jpg
│   │   └── traj_data.pkl
│   ├── <name_of_traj2>
│   │   ├── 0.jpg
│   │   ├── 1.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── T_2.jpg
│   │   └── traj_data.pkl
│   ...
|   ├── <name_of_trajN>
|   | 	├── 0.jpg
|   | 	├── 1.jpg
|   | 	├── ...
|   |   ├── T_N.jpg
|   |   └── traj_data.pkl
│   ├── train
|   |   └── traj_names.txt
└── └── test
        └── traj_names.txt 
``` 

#### Training your model from a checkpoint
Instead of training from scratch, you can also load an existing checkpoint from the published results.
Add `load_run: <project_name>/<log_run_name>`to your .yaml config file in `vint_release/train/config/`. The `*.pth` of the file you are loading to be saved in this file structure and renamed to “latest”: `vint_release/train/logs/<project_name>/<log_run_name>/latest.pth`. This makes it easy to train from the checkpoint of a previous run since logs are saved this way by default. Note: if you are loading a checkpoint from a previous run, check for the name the run in the `vint_release/train/logs/<project_name>/`, since the code appends a string of the date to each run_name specified in the config yaml file of the run to avoid duplicate run names. 


If you want to use our checkpoints, you can download the `*.pth` files from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a9yWR2iooXFAqjQHetz263--4_2FFggg?usp=sharing).


### Loading the model weights

Save the model weights *.pth file in `vint_release/deployment/model_weights` folder. Our model's weights are in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a9yWR2iooXFAqjQHetz263--4_2FFggg?usp=sharing).
